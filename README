FSM Editor

FSM Editor is a small implementation of a graphical editor for Finite State Machines.
It can be customized to save and load FSM graphs to any format or language by overriding the Settings class. It can also be embedded in another Qt project.
FSM Editor can run on any platform supported by Qt, including Windows, Unix and Mac OS.

Dependencies are:
- Qt 5.X
- CMake 3.X

If necessary, it should be possible to compile it with Qt4 by just adapting the CMake scpripts.

See INSTALL for compilation instructions.
