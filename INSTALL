This is a CMake project, that depends on Qt5. To install, you just need to call cmake on the root directory, from the folder you want generated files to be created into.
This far, the only necessary CMake variable is the path to Qt5 CMake files.

mkdir _generated
cd _generated
cmake path/to/fsm-editor -D Qt5Widgets_DIR=/path/to/qt5/lib/cmake/Qt5Widgets
